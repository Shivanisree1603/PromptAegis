# 🛡️ PromptAegis – Prompt Safety & Legal Compliance Checker

**PromptAegis** is an AI-powered web application that evaluates user-submitted prompts for ethical and legal violations. Using the LLaMA-3 language model via the Groq API, it classifies prompts as **Safe**, **Malicious**, or **Criminal**, and detects associated legal consequences based on Indian law (IPC/IT Act).

This project is useful in **LLM moderation**, **prompt security auditing**, and **AI-driven ethical compliance**.

## 🧠 How It Works

PromptAegis takes a user prompt and:

1. Sends it to the LLaMA-3 model via Groq API.
2. Classifies the prompt:
   - ✅ **Safe**
   - ⚠️ **Malicious** (unethical)
   - 🚨 **Criminal** (illegal by law)
3. Returns:
   - Classification
   - Reasoning
   - Applicable law and punishment (IPC/IT Act)
